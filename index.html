            <p>
                <strong>Breaking</strong> things and attemting to fix them is fasinating to me, I just have to know how things work. When I was learning how to drive my dad had to explain to me how a clutch and gear box works. This is why coding intreged me so much, its the inner workings of things I use every day, the clutch of a phone and a gearbox of the internet.

                <strong>Maddie</strong> sugested I check out a website <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> after i mentioned my interest into coding. Maddie, my sister, was a major part into the start of my journy into coding. She did not just give me a website to get started, she supported me when I was stuck on something and she was there when I needed to show off what I had acheived. Thank you Maddie xxx.

                <strong>Magical</strong> is how I would describe coding, how you can make anything you want, a application that counts how many times you unlock your phone, a website that lists all the times the president has been golf within there 4 years in the whitehouse, a game where you make mobile phones and expand a facrory and make it run faster untill you have no idea what is going on and your earning run of the page.
