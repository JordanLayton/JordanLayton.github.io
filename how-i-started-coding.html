                            <strong>Breaking</strong> things and attempting to fix them is fascinating to me, I just have to know how things work. When I was learning how to drive my dad had to explain to me how a clutch and gearbox works. This is why coding intrigued me so much, it's the inner workings of things I use every day, the clutch of a phone and a gearbox of the internet.

                            <strong>Maddie</strong> suggested I check out a website <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> after i mentioned my interest in coding. Maddie, my sister, was a major part of the start of my journey into coding. She did not just give me a website to get started, she supported me when I was stuck on something and she was there when I needed to show off what I had achieved. Thank you Maddie xxx.

                            <strong>Khan Academy</strong> is a fantastic tool to help learn coding. It makes the beginning, when you do not know anything, less daunting. The first few lessons make it fun and easy to get started and slowly introduces you to more complex things. The site also allows you to get out your creative impulses when you just want to get started on something.

                            <strong>Magical</strong> is how I would describe coding, how you can make anything you want, a application that counts how many times you unlock your phone, a website that lists all the times the president has been golf within there 4 years in the whitehouse, a game where you make mobile phones and expand a factory and make it run faster until you have no idea what is going on and your earning run of the page.
