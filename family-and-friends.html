        <strong>Steve</strong>  is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Everything changed when we first met as if we just clicked together like puzzle pieces made for each other. He is so smart and masters everything he does with ease. He has been there for me through the tough times and wonderful times and I am looking forward to spending the rest of my life with him.

            <strong>Janice</strong> & Steve are my parents. They are simply and I don't think there are any other words, amazing. In my opinion they have done an amazing job in raising me and my siblings, but I suppose you could say I'm biased. Thank you, both of you and I love you very very much.

            <strong>Chelsea</strong> is the oldest of my two sisters, married to my brother in law Matt. She is great at everything, her career as a dental hygienist and being a great mum to two daughters Violet and Esme.

            <strong>Maddie</strong> the youngest sister constantly amazes me. She is so smart, the smartest person I know. Maddie has the biggest heart and always wants to help others.

            <strong>Wendy</strong> & Dave are both two of the most wonderful people I have met. The first time I met them shaking with a box of donuts I brought as a gift, they welcomed me with open arms.

            <strong>Sam</strong> & Matt are put simply made for each other and make a great couple. They both have such a strong character and huge hearts, from the start have made me feel like part of the family.
